DJ Straus was born out of my desire to deliver a college musical experience that extended beyond hopelessly replayed top 40 songs. From Guns n Roses to Lady Gaga, The Beatles to LMFAO, my mashed up mixing cut across all genres, styles, and expectations.
<br></br>

Within a semester, Straus had played at a dozen major campus events and the monthly ten-minute mixes had garnered over 6,700 plays and 800+ downloads. The brand had by then become a well-known force for good in the campus music scene.
