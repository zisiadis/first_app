	Created by artist <%= link_to 'Charles Gadeken', 'http://charlesgadeken.com' %> and premiered at the 2012 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival,
	WAVE is the worldâ€™s tallest wave generator. It's constructed from four 30-foot towers that dance on the horizon, illuminated from within by full color LEDs and by fire at the apex. The slow moving, high amplitude transverse waves provide a physical example for the visualization of this complex and changing phenomena. WAVE thus takes architecture and science to the edge of abstraction.
<br></br>
	The overall effect of the work is massive, surreal, intimidating, hypnotic and simply stunning.
