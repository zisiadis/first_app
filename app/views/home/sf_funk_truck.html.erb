	Everyone loves music. So why not more of it?

	On a sunny Saturday afternoon in March 2012 the SF Funk Truck made its debut tour across the city. Needless to say, there was dancing, cheering, and just an all around good time had by all.

	Hardly anyone could bear to walk the streets that day without revealing a smile.
