 Balloonacy! was the World's First Ever Interactive Balloon Immersion.
<br></br>
On May 12-13, 2012 over 2,000 San Franciscans came out and rediscovered the playful side of life as they waded their way through a pitch black sea of thousands of light-emitting, motion-sensitive balloons. It was part dance-party, part existential crisis, and ALL FUN!

The project was graciously funded by <%= link_to 'The Awesome Foundation', 'http://awesomefoundation.org' %> and held in the <%= link_to 'Million Fishes', 'http://millionfishes.com' %> Gallery
